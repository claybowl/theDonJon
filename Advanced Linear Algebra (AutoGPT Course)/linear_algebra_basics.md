Linear Algebra Basics

Linear algebra is the study of vectors and linear transformations. It plays an essential role in mathematics, science, computer science, and engineering and provides a foundation for more advanced mathematics. Some basic concepts and terms are:

- Vectors
  * Components
  * Length of a vector
  * Dot product and angle between vectors
  * Vector addition and subtraction
  * Basis vectors
- Matrices
  * Square and rectangular matrices
  * Identity and zero matrices
  * Matrix multiplication
  * Transposes
  * Inverses
- Linear systems
  * Augmented matrices
  * Elementary row operations
  * Row reduction
  * Consistency and independence
  * Linear combinations
- Linear transformations
  * Matrix representations
  * Null space and range
  * Injectivity and surjectivity
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  * Definitions
  * Properties
  * Diagonalization
- Orthogonality and orthonormal bases
  * Inner products
  * Gram-Schmidt process
