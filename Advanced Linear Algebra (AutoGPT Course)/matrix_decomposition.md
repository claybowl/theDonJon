Matrix Decomposition

Matrix decomposition is the factorization of a matrix into smaller fundamental matrices. These fundamental matrices represent important properties and insight that can be gained about the original matrix. Matrix decomposition has applications in many fields, including physics, engineering, computer science, and data analysis. Some common matrix decompositions are:
