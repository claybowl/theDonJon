Matrix Factorization Resources

Matrix factorization is used in linear algebra to solve different classes of problems, particularly in the context of data analysis, optimization, and machine learning. Some of the most commonly used matrix factorization methods include LU, QR, Cholesky, polar, and singular value decompositions. These methods can be used to decompose and transform matrices to reveal important information about the data they contain, such as hidden patterns, relationships, or structure that is difficult to detect by other means.
