# Introduction to Advanced Linear Algebra
Welcome to our full introductory course on advanced linear algebra. In this course, we will explore advanced topics in linear algebra, building upon the foundational mathematics concepts that you may be familiar with. In this course, you will learn about topics including:

1. Vectors and Matrices
2. Linear Independence and Dependence
3. Elementary Matrix Operations
4. Linear Transformations
5. Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
6. Orthogonal bases and projections
7. Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
8. Least squares
9. Vector spaces
10. Inner Products.

By the end of this course, you will have a strong foundation in advanced linear algebra that you can use in a wide range of field of mathematics and data science. Let's start by studying the basic concepts of linear algebra and then move on to the more advanced topics in the field.
